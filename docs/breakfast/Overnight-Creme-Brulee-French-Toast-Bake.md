### Preparation Time: 15 minutes  
### Cooking Time: 30–35 minutes (plus overnight chilling)

### Ingredients List:
- 6 tablespoons (85 g) butter  
- ¾ cup (159 g) packed light or dark brown sugar  
- 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, corn syrup, or pancake syrup  
- 6 to 8 slices French bread (1-inch thick), cut into ¾-inch cubes  
- 4 large eggs  
- 1 cup half-and-half  
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract  
- ¼ teaspoon salt  
- Sweetened whipped cream, for serving  
- Fresh strawberries or raspberries, for serving  

### Instructions:
1. Add the butter, brown sugar, and syrup to a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 1–2 minutes, until the sugar is dissolved, then stir to combine. (This step can also be done in a saucepan on the stove.)
2. Lightly grease a 9×13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
3. Spread the brown sugar mixture evenly over the bottom of the pan. Arrange the bread cubes in a single layer on top.
4. In a bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together the eggs, half-and-half, vanilla extract, and salt.
5. Pour the egg mixture evenly over the bread cubes.
6. Cover the pan and refrigerate overnight (8–10 hours).
7. Remove the pan from the refrigerator, uncover it, and place it into a cold oven.
8. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Once the oven reaches temperature, bake for 30–35 minutes, until the bread is golden and the caramel syrup is bubbling.
9. Serve warm with sweetened whipped cream and fresh strawberries or raspberries.

### Notes:
- For extra caramelized goodness on top, bake for 20 minutes, then carefully flip the bread pieces with a large spatula and bake for an additional 10–15 minutes.
- Slightly stale bread works best, as it absorbs the custard without becoming soggy.

!!! note
    This dish must be assembled the night before, so plan ahead for best results. Be careful when flipping the bread halfway through baking, as the caramel syrup will be very hot.
