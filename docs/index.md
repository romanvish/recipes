# Getting started
Hello my friends :) welcome to my recipe site. The goal in building this was to digitize my own recipes and hopefully get some contributions from you all because I know there are some things I've had at your houses that have been very good.  <br><br>
I've designed the site to (hopefully) be faily logical in how to organize things, but there are two things involved here that some of you may not be familiar with so I'll explain them below, they are GitHub and Markdown.  <br><br>
GitHub is a place where a lot of code is stored on the internet, in order to have direct access to upload and write your own recipes, you'll have to sign up for a GitHub account (they're free and easy to set up, and very secure)  <br><br>
Markdown is kind of like a fancy version of writing with microsoft word, there are specific characters that have meaning to sites like this one that help the site format it to make it look all nice and pretty. There is a Markdown helper on the sidebar, but frankly I just throw stuff into ChatGPT and it'll make the Markdown for you. I'll also include a recipe template on the sidebar so you can just paste that into Chat and say "make my recipe in this format" and should work fine.  <br><br>
On the sidebar should also be how to add recipes walkthrough that I'll keep up to date as a reference <br><br>
Hope you enjoy and add your recipes so that we can all share and compare notes :smile: if you have any questions or run into issues I'd be happy to help out.
